# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the solidness and impact of hits in the game by improving visual, audio, and tactile feedback systems. Currently, the game has basic hit effects including hit sparks, screen shake, and hit pause, but these can be enhanced to create more satisfying and impactful combat feedback that makes hits feel more substantial and responsive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want hits to feel more impactful and satisfying, so that combat feels responsive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player successfully hits an enemy THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced visual feedback through improved particle effects
2. WHEN a hit connects THEN the system SHALL apply variable screen shake intensity based on hit type and enemy
3. WHEN a critical hit or charged attack connects THEN the system SHALL provide amplified feedback effects
4. WHEN multiple hits occur in succession THEN the system SHALL scale feedback intensity appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want different types of hits to feel distinct, so that I can understand the impact and effectiveness of my attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a regular attack hits THEN the system SHALL provide standard intensity feedback
2. WHEN a charged attack hits THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced feedback with longer duration
3. WHEN a critical hit occurs THEN the system SHALL provide distinctive visual and tactile feedback
4. WHEN hitting different enemy types THEN the system SHALL vary feedback based on enemy properties

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want hit timing and rhythm to feel consistent, so that combat flows smoothly without jarring interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hits occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL prevent feedback stacking that creates jarring effects
2. WHEN hit pause is active THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent timing across all feedback elements
3. WHEN multiple enemies are hit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL coordinate feedback appropriately
4. WHEN combo attacks occur THEN the system SHALL enhance feedback progressively

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual hit effects to be clear and readable, so that I can track combat effectiveness in busy scenes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hit effects are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure effects are visible against all backgrounds
2. WHEN multiple effects overlap THEN the system SHALL layer effects to maintain readability
3. WHEN hit effects animate THEN the system SHALL use appropriate timing to avoid visual clutter
4. WHEN screen shake occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain UI readability and stability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want hit feedback to be customizable or adaptive, so that the experience matches my preferences and hardware capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game detects performance constraints THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust effect intensity
2. WHEN hit feedback becomes repetitive THEN the system SHALL provide subtle variations to maintain engagement
3. WHEN accessibility needs are considered THEN the system SHALL provide alternative feedback methods
4. WHEN different input methods are used THEN the system SHALL adapt feedback appropriately
