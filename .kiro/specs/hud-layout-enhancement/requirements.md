# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HUD (Heads-Up Display) in the game currently has issues with text overflow, particularly with the MP (Magic Points) display. This feature aims to improve the HUD layout to ensure all information is clearly visible and properly contained within its designated UI elements, enhancing the overall user experience and visual clarity during gameplay.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want all HUD elements to display properly within their containers, so that I can easily read my stats during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MP value is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure the text fits completely within its container without overflow
2. WHEN the MP value has many digits (e.g., "99/100" or "999/1000") THEN the system SHALL adjust the text display to fit within the fixed container width
3. WHEN any stat value changes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper text containment regardless of the new value's length
4. WHEN the HUD is resized THEN the system SHALL ensure all stat boxes have sufficient width for typical gameplay values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the HUD to maintain fixed dimensions regardless of stat values, so that the interface remains consistent and stable during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HUD panel is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain fixed container dimensions regardless of text content
2. WHEN stat boxes are created THEN the system SHALL use fixed width containers and adjust text size or format to fit within them
3. WHEN stat values change THEN the system SHALL keep container sizes constant and adapt the text display accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the HUD to maintain visual consistency regardless of the values displayed, so that the game interface looks polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different stat values are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual styling across all HUD elements
2. WHEN the game is in different states (e.g., low MP, high MP) THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate visual feedback without breaking the layout
3. WHEN the game resolution changes THEN the system SHALL ensure the HUD scales appropriately while maintaining text containment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to clearly distinguish between different stat values in the HUD, so that I can quickly assess my character's status during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple stats are displayed side by side THEN the system SHALL ensure clear visual separation between them
2. WHEN stat values are updated THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback without disrupting readability
3. IF a stat value exceeds a certain threshold THEN the system SHALL ensure the display remains legible and contained
